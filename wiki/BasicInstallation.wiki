  # Download Tomcat from http://tomcat.apache.org and set it up following their instructions. 
  # Download urigen.war from the Downloads tabs of this page. Place the urigen.war in the webapps folder in your Tomcats home directory. 
  # Assuming you used tomcat's default settings, your URIGen web interface should be available no http://localhost:8080/urigen

== Setting up the admin account ==

For a fresh installation you will need to create the first administrator account. All you need is a valid e-mail address and an internet connection. Login and authentication is handled using browserid.org, just follow the instruction. Once your admin account is created you can create new accounts for other users, and also assign other users to be admins.
