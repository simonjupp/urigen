# URIGen

URIGen is a Java API and web service for managing the creation of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). URIGen provides collaborative ontology development projects, like EFO and SWO, with a centralised server to manage their URI creation policy. URIGen provides a REST interface, a web client and a Protege 4.1 plugin for interacting with the URIGen server.
