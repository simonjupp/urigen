#summary REST API to the URIGen system

= Introduction =

URIGen has a REST API that supports most of the CRUD functions for maintaining the URIGen database. The REST API is accessible by appending *api* to the end of the URIGen default URL. All the following examples assume interaction with the REST API using curl, and a server running on localhost:8080
 

= Users =

  * Get all users

{{{
curl -X GET -v http://localhost:8080/urigen/api/users
}}}

  * Get user by user id
{{{
curl -X GET -v http://localhost:8080/urigen/api/{userid}
}}}
