#summary Protege plugin instruction

= Introduction =

You can use the URIGen Protege 4.1 plugin to access a URIGen server from Protege. You can map an ontology URI to a URIGen server, so that each time a new entity is created in Protege, it will get the next URI in sequence for that ontology. 

== Installation ==

Download the org.protege.urigen.jar from the downloads page. Put this jar inside your Protege home directory, inside the plugins folder. Restart protege. 

== URIGen Protege setup ==

To activate URIGen within Protege, open the Protege preferences and navigate to the New Entities Server Tab.
